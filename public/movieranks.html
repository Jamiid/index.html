<h2>My 6 current favourate movies</h2>
<hr />

<h3>Spider man no way home</h3>
<p>As a spider man fan since i was a child i loved how they brought together toby magire and andrew garfield and tom holland with referances to past movies and still managed to tell a brilliant story.</p>

<h3>Deadpool 1 & 2</h3>
<p>I just love ryan reynolds portrayal of deadpool it was like he was born to play the charater, full of action and comedy whilst being easy to watch.</p>

<h3>Logan</h3>
<p>i've always loved wolverine but i always felt like their was something missing, turns out it wasnt R rated which gives a more gritty, more accurate portrayal of logan.</p>

<h3>Man in uncle</h3>
<P>I have a soft spot for spy movies and i love Man in uncle for its creative comic style and unique take from guy riche.</P>

<h3>The Gentleman</h3>
<P>Another movie from guy riche that has a unquie style and has great characters, action and twists through out the movie.</P>
